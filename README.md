# DataDrivenRulesEngine

## Overview
DataDrivenRulesEngine is a flexible and dynamic rule processing engine designed to evaluate business logic based on rules defined in JSON format. This project allows users to define complex conditions and actions without hardcoding them into the application, promoting modularity and maintainability.

## Features
- Load rules from JSON files
- Process conditions and execute actions
- Supports both integer and string comparisons
- Nested rule execution

## Getting Started

To get started with OrientionData, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Choose the technology you want to use (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C#, Ruby) and clone the corresponding folder:
git clone <repository-url> cd <technology-folder-name>

2. **Install dependencies:**
Make sure to install any required dependencies for your chosen technology.

3. **Define your rules:**
Create JSON files for your rules as per the expected format.

4. **Run the application:**
Execute the main application file according to your chosen language.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
JSON files for rule definitions


#Usage
To use the rules engine, instantiate the OrientionData class and call the ProcessRulesOd method with the desired parameters.

Python
```python

from OrientionData import OrientionData

od = OrientionData()
result = od.ProcessRulesOd(your_rule_definition, value1, value2)
```
JavaScript 
```JavaScript

```
